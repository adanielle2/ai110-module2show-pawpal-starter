# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## Smarter Scheduling

PawPal+ goes beyond a simple to-do list. The scheduler includes four pieces of algorithmic intelligence:

**Sorting by deadline**
Tasks are sorted by priority first (HIGH before MEDIUM before LOW), then by `deadline_hour` within each tier so the most urgent task in a group always schedules first.

**Filtering**
The `Scheduler` exposes `sort_by_time()`, `filter_by_status()`, and `filter_by_pet()` methods. `Owner` also provides `get_tasks_by_pet()`, `get_tasks_by_status()`, and `get_tasks_by_category()` so the UI can show targeted views without returning everything.

**Recurring tasks**
Each `Task` has a `frequency` field (`"daily"`, `"weekly"`, or `"once"`). When `Pet.complete_task()` is called, it marks the task done and automatically appends the next occurrence with a new `due_date` calculated using `timedelta`. One-off tasks are not repeated.

**Conflict detection**
Before building the plan, `_detect_conflicts()` scans for two types of problems: tasks that share the same `deadline_hour` (potential overlap) and tasks whose projected start time already exceeds their deadline. Conflicts are collected as warning strings and shown at the top of the plan — the scheduler never crashes, it just tells you what to watch out for.
